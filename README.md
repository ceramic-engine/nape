# nape

Nape physics library by Luca Deltodesco, usable as a git submodule for haxe.

This is simply a clone of [nape library on haxelib](https://lib.haxe.org/p/nape/), but useable without haxelib, as a git submodule.

Files in this repo are usable as is from haxe project. There already have been processed from their [original source](https://github.com/deltaluca/nape) written using [caxe](https://github.com/deltaluca/caxe) preprocessor.
